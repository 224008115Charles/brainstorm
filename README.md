Brainstorm is a WIP general purpose note-taking application.

## [DEMO](http://brainstorm-notes.meteor.com)

Features

* Note taking
  * Live preview of what you're writing
  * Partially supports Github Flavored markdown (no todo's yet)

* Editing notes
* Deleting notes
* Grid-based note viewing
* Isolating groups of notes by tag-name
* Works on different screen sizes
* Sharing separate notes

Currently working on:
---

Most importantly is, when going public with this application, that notes can be secured. In the coming time, I'll be working on note-security.

There'll be a developer blog post (using brainstorm of course), with more details on the subject later.

Issues that need fixing:
---

Right now, there are no critical issues. If you find anything, please open up an issue.

Todo features
---

1. Note boards
2. Widgets
3. Accounts
4. Per-board access/privacy configuration (think access by link, or by invite amongst other options)

Goal
---

A solid open-source note-taking application which can be used for several different tasks:

1. Generic note taking
2. Planning
3. Cheat sheets
4. Free-writing
5. Microblogging
6. Extensibility
